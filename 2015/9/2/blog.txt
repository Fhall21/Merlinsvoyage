Between kid’s stuffs, boat TLC, various commitments and still enjoying the Brisbane River, our weekends can be quite busy. I don't always take the time to share, so here are few snap shots of our ending weekend.

We had our own and special birthday on board too. Victor is now 15, tall as Greg and still growing. 15? Where did the time go?
