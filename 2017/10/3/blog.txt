Paragraph:|
Our weekends have been just too busy with some climbing, music, and unfortunately work. Most of the time, we can’t even blame an uncooperative weather for not going sailing. However this weekend had the right tides/winds and weather so we missed the amazing fireworks that we usually go to to shake Merlin’s sails again. For the 1st time while crossing Moreton Bay, we saw some whales. A mother and her calf were swimming leisurely only 100m from Merlin.

Paragraph:|
Quiet time on board, playing lots of games, eating “crepes”, reading and just relaxing …between some hull-cleaning too for Greg.

Paragraph:|
The long weekend was aborted due to bad weather coming up: strong winds (30knt) and heavy rains. As the bay can be very choppy with strong winds, we decided to head back to Brisbane only to encounter some happy dolphins.
|Paragraph:|
It was really nice being anchored again, watcing together a nice sunset and a peaceful starry sky.

Back at the dock waiting for some (also overdue) rain
