Paragraph:|
Friday morning, Victor started his 40h challenge (see few posts below). As promised he went to school without shoes (and socks).

Paragraph:|
With Felix, they also decided not to use furniture – which might be easier on a boat as we found that “furniture are the movable articles that are used to make a room or building suitable for living or working in, such as tables, chairs, or desks”.  Apart from three chairs, there is nothing “movable” on Merlin. The boys still did their homework sitting on the floor and Felix played his clarinet at the conservatorium standing up. To help Felix finish his challenge, we went for a walk as you don’t have any furniture in the forest.
