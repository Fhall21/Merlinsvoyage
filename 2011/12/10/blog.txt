Paragraph:|
Some have their holiday getaway; we have our week-end anchorage. It is always with a huge smile and a great pleasure that we take Merlin out in Moreton Bay and anchor in front of the big white sand dunes. This week-end, Victor invited his friend Jack to discover life on board and share the fun.Always the same excitement to think of the best way to slide down, always the same effort to climb these big dunes under the strong sun and always the same fun. Not always the same figures, the same tumbles nor the same laughters but we always have such a good time.
