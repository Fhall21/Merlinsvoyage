Paragraph:|
We have had a great day today. Everyone is feeling better and we had a fast day with the spinnaker this afternoon. We have currently got 30 knots from the south and large sea so we only have a small jib and three reefs. With this little sail we are still doing 7.5 knots.
|Paragraph:|
Our current position is 30deg 43.76'S and 10deg 04.43'E, which means that we have done 442NM so far.
