Paragraph:|
Today we are all very sad. Our dear friend Teresa reached the end of her journey yesterday losing her battle against cancer. We were neighbours in Cape Town and quickly became very good friends, chatting over our common fence, inviting each other, waking together, sharing good times. She moved back to the States, we moved to Merlin but we always followed our respective adventures trying to meet whenever possible. One amongst so many incredible things she did was to start this blog during her visit in Grenada back in 2009.
|Paragraph:|
We’ll remember her generosity, her sensitivity, her determination, her will to help people and most of all her contagious smile.
