Paragraph:|
Handball is a very popular game in the school playgrounds in Australia. Two players are throwing a bouncing ball (eg a tennis ball). Tthe ball needs to bounce on both side of a 4sm field on each shot.  The rules are very similar to ping pong. There was today “the first Australian handball festival” organised in our nearby park. Victor, Felix and Clea participated. As you can see from below, they each have their own style! Felix, who is practicing a lot every day, got to the semi-final of the boys under 12.

Paragraph:|
Still on the sport side, Clea finally rode her bike without her training wheels. She is very proud and happy to be able to ride on her own. We are hoping that more practice will allow us (very soon?) to enjoy all the riding paths on the river side.
