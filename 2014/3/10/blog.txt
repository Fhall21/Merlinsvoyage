Paragraph:|
Today I was asked this question for the third time this week. It is not easy for me to answer such a question. I come from France, but lived in 3 different corners of the country, then lived in South Africa for more than 10 years, then we travelled for few years. From time to time, I feel really French but could also be really proud to be a South African resident (NB if there is a rugby game France vs Springboks I will cheer for the blue team!). So instead of answering  directly, I now asked "why do you ask". Most of the time it is my accent which is confusing with a bit of French flair, a South African twist and maybe now a drop of Australian twang.  However I feel cosmopolitan and a citizen of our world.
