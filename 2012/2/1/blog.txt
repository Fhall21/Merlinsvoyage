Paragraph:|
The Menu 
|Paragraph:|
I felt hungry
|Paragraph:|
Oh what a pity
|Paragraph:|
I went passed a doorway
|Paragraph:|
Then I heard him say
|Paragraph:|
“Which way?”
|Paragraph:|
It was a poor door like a doorway which was crying.
|Paragraph:|
“What’s the problem? Are you shouting?”
|Paragraph:|
I asked “What! I am not flying or standing?”
|Paragraph:|
Said the doorway “Want to go thru?”
|Paragraph:|
“First, what’s your name?” I asked – “Mu!”
|Paragraph:|
He replied
|Paragraph:|
Like he lied
|Paragraph:|
How could I resist, I was so hungry
|Paragraph:|
Why was Mu crying? May be I was scary?
|Paragraph:|
So I went 10m back and then I was running thru
|Paragraph:|
I was running to a black and red table with a menu
|Paragraph:|
I sat down, looked at the menu then I felt
|Paragraph:|
Something pointy on my head, like a belt
|Paragraph:|
Then I heard him say “Hi or bye, look I can fly!”
|Paragraph:|
High like a pie, my mouth cannot lie neither did I
|Paragraph:|
Lie or say goodbye “said a dancing dog
|Paragraph:|
Hey, do not call me a red log!”
