Paragraph:|
b"This year seems to be a very interesting one as there is a school trip to Base Camp, Himalaya, Nepal. We just received our physical program to prepare for the trip; 3 runs a term, a few day hikes, running up stairs and altitude training. The problem is, this trip is quite expensive! That means I'm really going to need to contribute and get a job!"

b"HOwever, it seems more and more real now. Just a few days ago, we started buying few stuff to prepare for the Base Camp trip. The saleman went ther ethree times and gave me some tips. Here are the Sstuff I still will need to buy appart from special shoes and clothes: Lip balm x3 as I might get real dry and craked lips there, hand wash, toilet paper (apparently the toilet paper there is real rough so I'll be able to swap a few sheets of it for food or a few cents \xf0\x9f\x98\x84)and good sock."
