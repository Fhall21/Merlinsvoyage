Paragraph:|
Clea and Victor participated today in the Queensland lead climbing competition. They've trained really hard these last two months, going climbing at least 4 times a week. It was a long, hot and humid day at the climbing gym but what an amazing day. Clea surprised everybody by finishing first in her category, showing us her most beautiful smile but also all her great progress since she started a year ago.
