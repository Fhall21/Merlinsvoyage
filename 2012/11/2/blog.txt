Paragraph:|
I thought that eclipses were very rare phenomena, so during one of my clearing/cleaning session, I threw away our special eclipses glasses used in Bora Bora 2 years ago. It was without knowing that the sun and the moon will play soon enough another game of peek-a-boo for us.  Today, in the north of Queensland there was a total eclipse. In Brisbane, we only had an 80% eclipse at 6:55 this morning. It is usually bright enough at that time and we could see the light getting dimmed. Without our special glasses, we used other methods to see the sun getting smaller and smaller. With a mirror, Felix was reflecting the sun on our neighbours ‘hull.

Paragraph:|
Clea tried a welding mask, which is, in fact, like eclipse glasses but only bulkier.

We also tried the pricked paper method and reflecting it through our binoculars.

When and where will our next one be?
