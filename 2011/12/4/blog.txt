Paragraph:|
I believe Santa Claus is real.
|Paragraph:|
I believe this because few years ago I saw him in the air with his deers and on his own sleigh. I saw him in Fortaleza (in Brazil). I saw him again on the top of the highest sky scraper. Now let me prove you that Santa Claus is real.
|Paragraph:|
1- I took a photo of Santa Claus in the air. He was going to my neighbours’s house. However, the next day I couldn’t find my camera again. I was 5 year old when I took this photo.
|Paragraph:|
2-I saw Santa again in Brazil. It was in Fortaleza on Christmas evening. I was going to do a film of him with my camera. But I fell asleep and I couldn’t stop the film. The next morning I discovered that I forgot to stop the film. When I checked the little movie, I saw Santa Claus again.
|Paragraph:|
Now this is my 3rd prove to show you that Santa Claus is real. I heard his big foot steps on the deck. The foot steps were too loud to be my parents’ foots steps. That time. Santa Claus arrived on board very late instead of early in the morning.
|Paragraph:|
Hopefully, I convinced you enough that Santa Claus is real.
