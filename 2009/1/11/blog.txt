Paragraph:|
We feel like we are in a washing machine as the sea is really bunpy. The wind is from the side resulting in the large swells rocking the boat from side to side. The wind has continued blowing resulting in some fast sailing. Today we got over the 1000NM mark for this trip and should be in Tobago in about four days. That would result in a total time of 9 days vs our original plan of 14 days!
|Paragraph:|
I think that we are all looking forward to some calm anchorages off white beaches.
|Paragraph:|
Our current position is 7 deg 14,24'N and 51 deg 49,12'W we are doing between 7,5 and 9 knots.
