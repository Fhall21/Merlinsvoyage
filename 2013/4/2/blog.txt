Paragraph:|
Great sunny day on this public holiday and great program: mountain ride first then picnic in the forest with some friends. Despite his hangover, Greg managed to put our 4 mountain bikes on our new bike rack.

Paragraph:|
We had a great time riding in the eucalyptus forest until 2min before the finish line and Felix’s tumble. Greg was behind him and apparently it was a 9/10 fall. Unfortunately Felix lost consciousness and was really shocked. We finished our day at the emergency unit, having Felix under observation over night because of concussion.

Paragraph:|
He is now fine, found his smile again, needs to catch up with some sleep and heals all his grazes.
