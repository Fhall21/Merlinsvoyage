Paragraph:|
I am back from France for few days already and I am trying to get rid of my jet lag.  I really enjoyed my free time with no young crew, no homework, activities and meals to organise, no deck to clean and no water tank to fill up. I had long strolls in Paris streets, browsing around and lifting my head admiring all these historical (and less historical) buildings.

Paragraph:|
I was drooling in front of the bakeries, dreaming in the book shops and amazed by all the people who were speaking French! Then I went to Alsace. For Father’s day, my half-sisters and I surprised our Dad with a good dinner. I enjoyed the peace of the close vineyards and the calm village life in Orschwhir.

Paragraph:|
I went for runs in the countryside to try to eliminate all the extra calories (who can say no to good cheeses, bread and wine?).

Paragraph:|
However, my warmhearted time with my family was the best of all. It ended with a beautiful wedding full of emotions.
