Paragraph:|
Felix started his holidays with a 16km walk through the bush, carrying his full pack (food, tent, sleeping bag etc) … that unfortunatelly got drenched even before he started (thanks to a leaky water bottle).

Paragraph:|
Thankfully, the sun was out, drying everything quickly. HOwever he then had to boil some water from the lake to have enough to drink. This walk was quite steep and proved quickly that his walking shoes were sadly too small. He came back with few blisters but happy to have ticked the most adventurous requirement of his Duke of Edinburgh project - which for a well trained scout wasn't so hard!
|Paragraph:|
After dropping Felix on Saturday, the rest of us also went for a hike, less challenging but with great views. Just perfect to start these schools holidays.
