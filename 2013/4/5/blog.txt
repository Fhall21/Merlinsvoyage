Paragraph:|
4 days off + good (enough) weather + cruising friends wanted to join us = enough reasons to go out in the bay, shake Merlin's sails and have loads of fun.

Paragraph:|
Our French cruising neighbours and friends, Kappa and Singa, are leaving Dockside so we decided to meet in the bay and enjoy being anchored all together.
|Paragraph:|
The kids came on board for few games before we left (Merlin seems to be a very child friendly boat).

We had fun again on the dunes, enjoyed the sun, and it was even better to be there with some friends.
