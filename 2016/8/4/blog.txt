Paragraph:|
Clea is building her entrepreneurial skills! She initiated a project at school and formed a team with two other friends to try to have a greener school. They would like to use all the green waste to make some compost for the little veggie garden next to the school. They advertised a fundraising bake stall and proudly sold cakes two weeks ago. They raised an amazing amount of more than $600!
