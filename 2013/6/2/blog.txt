Paragraph:|
Most of the time, we hang our laundry in the cockpit. It is a well-ventilated space and very well-protected from the rain. As it is quite spacious too, there is enough space to hang a full wash. What takes space and pegs are the socks. So they sometimes end up on the life line. For that purpose, it is important to have the proper pegs.

Paragraph:|
We love our pegs so much that we had some send over from Cape Town when we were in the Caribbean. We are still using the same ones. They are 100% plastic, which helps hugely for avoiding rust stains on clothes. They float when we lost one over board which makes it much easier to catch. They have three clipping positions, so perfect for the life lines, our cockpit washing line and even the genoa sheets.
