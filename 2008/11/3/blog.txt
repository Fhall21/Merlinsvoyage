Paragraph:|
We have had another quiet day on the water. So much so that we put up our second spinnaker to help us along. We had it up for most of the day with me watching it closely.
|Paragraph:|
We had sundowners this evening with coke for the kids, red wine and pringles. This was followed we pizzas and orange peel boats. School is getting back into swing with three hours been done this morning.
|Paragraph:|
Our current position is 19deg 12,91'S and 2deg 39,10'W being 1 360NM from Cape Town and about 250NM from St Helene. Our current speed is 5 knots with the wind directly behind us. We are expecting some more wind over the next three days so hopefully our daily distance will increase.
