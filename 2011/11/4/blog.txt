Paragraph:|
Three years ago Table  Mountain was disappearing slowly behind us. We were heading West with a tight knot in our stomach, a smile on our face and without knowing what will await us.

Paragraph:|
Three years later, we still have a smile on our face and we stopped (for a little while) going West, at least with the sails up. The knots are here but only to keep Merlin tightly moored at Dockside Marina. Do we really know what awaits us everyday? Not too sure…
|Paragraph:|
Lots of changes happened during this time and the posts of this blog tell you about our many discoveries. Many other details are not mentioned: Victor is more than 20cm taller and he can now wear my shoes (however, being a boy he prefers not). Felix doesn’t even wear Victor’s clothes from when we left. He too grew a lot. He can write and read in two languages. The boys still speak about Cape Town, and odd details of their life there. They are begging me to bake some koeksisters for example. Clea, the boat girl, tries to copy her brothers by telling stories about “Rhodes Cottage”, but clearly can’t remember a thing of our old house. In three years, so much happened in her life. The bags of nappies which were filling up the lockers when we left are only old memories. She prepares her own breakfast and starts reading. Most importantly, she knows how to steer a boat, how to make a call on the VHF and what AIS is.
|Paragraph:|
Today, we are still under the Southern Cross and only 5 deg closer to the Equator. The Ocean next door became the Pacific. Strelizias and agapanthus are still flowering along our paths. We call it more BBQ but we still braai. Greg and I have more grey hair and more wrinkles and most of all, we are very proud of what happened since Table  Mountain disappeared.
