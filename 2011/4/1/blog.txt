Paragraph:|
b'Moreton  Island is just few miles away from the big city and offers white sand  beaches and good anchorages. So with no much wind forecasted and with  the wish of being anchored off these beaches we left Dockside Marina  early Friday morning. After 2 hours of motoring in the Brisbane River we  were in blue waters again.'
|Paragraph:|
b'It  was the start, at noon, of the famous Brisbane to Gladstone Race and  Greg couldn\xe2\x80\x99t resist being close to the line. With tens of other boats,  we enjoyed our sandwiches watching all these fast boats trying to catch  the little breeze.'

Paragraph:|
b'We  anchored off Tangalooma (away from all the other boats who had the same  idea) and were happy to have a great sunset as the backdrop for our  first night out.'

Paragraph:|
b'The next day, to avoid mutiny on board, we had to  please the young crew and motored few miles South (of course we had the  wind on the nose!) to find the white sand dunes we enjoyed so much in  January. We stayed there for the rest of the long week-end. There were  quite few other boats (50+) around us but this anchorage is huge\xe2\x80\xa6however  not too protected from the weather we had. So, as the weather changed  becoming windier and the seas bumpier, we ended up just with a couple of  other cruisers by Monday.'
|Paragraph:|
b'We  went sliding the big dunes few times, having a ball rolling over,  running down the slopes, enjoying the great weather and the great views  from the top of the biggest hill. After their 1st session, the kids decided to eat less sand and be more protected. So they went down with goggles and snorkels.'

Paragraph:|
b'Of  course we had the visit on Sunday of \xe2\x80\x9cMr Long Ears\xe2\x80\x9d who left chocolate  all around Merlin.'

Paragraph:|
b'The kids gobbled up their treats in less time than you can say "Happy Easter" and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand why they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have Nutella on  their pancakes that evening.'
|Paragraph:|
b'We played games, watched movies, ate a lot, read, slept and it was too soon that this super long week ended up.\xc2\xa0'

Paragraph:|
b'We  sailed back to the river mouth, with 3 reefs and doing 8.5knt. We  arrived safely on our pontoon, under a hard rain but a delicious home  made pizza was warming up the atmosphere of the saloon.\xc2\xa0'
