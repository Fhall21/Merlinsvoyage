Paragraph:|
We are not too sure why, but Father’s day is in the 1st week-end of September in Australia (commercial reasons?). The kids had few presents and kisses ready for their dad.

Paragraph:|
We then went mountain biking in a great place where even Clea could try for the first time her riding skills on dirt paths, where we could enjoy a picnic under some gum trees (hey, we are in Australia!) and where Gregory and the boys could go bouncing even more through the bush trails.
