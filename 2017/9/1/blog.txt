Paragraph:|
For their birthdays, Victor and Felix had an Open Water diving course. They started with a pool session on Monday and then had their sea dives at Tweed Heads. We all went there (1h ½ south of Brisbane) for 2 days of sea and fun. They had a very entertaining and dynamic instructor who was just perfect.

Paragraph:|
The sea conditions were not the best especially for the first 2 dives as it was quite windy, so the vis was only 2 meters, making their dives challenging. The 2nd day was less windy and they both ended with a big smile and a new dive certificate – which off course makes their dad really happy and proud too!
