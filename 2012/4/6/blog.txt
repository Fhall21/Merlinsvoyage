Paragraph:|
Greg had an early flight this morning to go back to Cape Town for 2 weeks (obviously not early enough for Felix who was up for the good bye photo). It’s going to be fun for him to travel with a stronger currency. So, he left with a small shopping list, especially boat stuff, like a new bright red bimini.

Paragraph:|
However and hopefully, shopping is not the main priority. He is joining his brother Malcolm’s 40th party and is really excited about the sporty program planed (skydiving and kite surfing) and about going back home after 3 ½ years. Interesting photos should be posted soon.
