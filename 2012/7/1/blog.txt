Paragraph:|
We woke up at 5:30am on Saturday to watch the opening of the Olympic Games. Cold temperature but warm spirit on board. We are now all ready for 2 weeks of sport, each of us supporting different teams (of course France and South Africa but also Australia for Clea). We spoke about the Olympic spirit, Pierre de Coubertin, about some special races and stories. Proudly, the kids are telling all their friends at school that their dad nearly went to the Olympics in 1992, but the trapeze wire snapped at the last race of the trials.

Paragraph:|
However, as the weather was just too beautiful, we couldn’t just being glued all day in front of our TV watching the replays so we went to the countryside to find a Geocache. For those who don’t know, they are little cheap treasures hidden in all kind of places and you find them using their GPS position. Felix was today in charge of the GPS, the directions and he found the treasures in a stump.

Victor asked Greg if he had the choice what he would have done: the Olympics or go cruising around the world. It took him few minutes to reply, but the answer was…cruising.
