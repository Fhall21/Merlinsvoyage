Paragraph:|
We’ve been quite busy these last two weeks and wanted to have done more but our week-ends are just too short.
|Paragraph:|
Felix had his birthday party last week end. Watching this group of 11 kids (3 were ours) having fun on the dock and the deck made me think again about the benefits of travelling the world. I am so grateful that our sailing trip didn’t give us only memories of amazing landscapes. Felix’s friends came from 7 different countries (Thailand, India, Sri Lanka, Papa New Guinea etc) and these kids didn’t care at all. Multiculturism is just normal for them. We could learn so much from this young generation.

Paragraph:|
They had fun building and then racing their wooden cars.

Paragraph:|
Clea was practising, for the last few weeks, a song she composed as she wanted to participate to the “Shine” competition at school (a talent competition). She didn’t want to rehearse in front of us but was fine to sing in front of 100 other kids. Apparently she did well, was happy and is thinking of a new song for the next round.
|Paragraph:|
Following her wish to have a pet, she made a trap on our neignour's boat, in the hope of catching a bird. Alas, none were caught.

Paragraph:|
She also joined me on a radio program dedicated to some of our favourite cartoons. She nearly chewed on the microphone but had fun trying to explain why she likes "TomTom et Nana". The podcast is available till Sat 16th (select French as usual) otherwise you could hear her (and me) from next week on Global Digital.
|Paragraph:|
Felix went on a new music audition for a school entry. His fingers were shaking and he had to change his reed 4 times before he had played. It is such a good stress management exercise and he starts learning a few tricks.
|Paragraph:|
This morning Victor started a new challenge to raise money to help kids living in poverty areas overseas. This year he decided to leave all electronic items on the side for 40hours. You could help him reach his fundraising goal, if you wish, by clicking here.
|Paragraph:|
How about Greg and myself? We try to manage our work-family life balance as best as possible. It might be unbalanced from time to time: too much work for Greg and too much family taxing for me. It is then we all listen to Mother Nature’s call. We went on Wednesday (Public Holiday here) for another great walk in the rain forest, feeling we could be lost in a chapter of Bilbo the Hobbit. Huge trees, amazing birds’ songs and even a sneaky snake.  We finished our 11km walk running under the rain but were rewarded by bright rainbows.
