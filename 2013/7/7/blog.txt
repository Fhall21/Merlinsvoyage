Paragraph:|
The name of your boat is important as it becomes your own name very quickly, especially when you cruise and live-aboard. The shorter and simpler the better. Two/three syllables would be a good length. You will have to repeat your boat’s name many times over the VHF, you want to make it easy to remember and pronounce (may be in few languages if you are traveling from country to country). We remember original names better (examples we met are Bubbles, Pickles) as the classic names (Serenity, Liberty, Shearwater, Serendipity, Cool Breeze) are too commonly seen around. The ones inspired by the moon (Moon shadow, Moon shine, Moon lighter), by the sea (Seaduction, Seafari, Sea horse, Sea Hawk, Sea Dog, Sea Monster, GypSea, Sea Quest), by the stage (Wild dancer, Wind Dancer, Wave Dancer, Moon and Sun Dancer) or by dreams (Dream Catcher, Dream Chaser, Dream Maker) are also very ordinary.
|Paragraph:|
Some relate boats and finances very tightly, as an investment or a financial burden. Here are three of our neighbours in Dockside Marina (Portfolio was another one but was sold few months ago):

Paragraph:|
When we were thinking of our boat’s name, Merlin came very quickly. Merlin was our old cat who unfortunately wouldn’t be able to join the crew. Because we are sailing on a “cat” this name always reminds us of "Merlin teh Cat" (in fact we tend to say more “he” than “she” when we speak about "Merlin the boat").
|Paragraph:|
Other important fact, Merlin can be pronounced and remembered easily in various languages and it is nice to be called the Merlins!
