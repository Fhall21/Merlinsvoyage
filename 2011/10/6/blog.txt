Paragraph:|
Yesterday, the kids stayed on board with pop corn and TV while we went to watch the ¼ final of the rugby world cup. I was drinking an Irish beer with my South African husband in an Australian pub but my heart was 100% French!
|Paragraph:|
On the other hand, the kids are proudly South African and were cheering the Bokes loudy this afternoon.
|Paragraph:|
It seems that even after so many travels, we still belong to where we were born.
