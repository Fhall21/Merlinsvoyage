Paragraph:|
b'We motored back to Brisbane River with a stop overnight at anchor. Our compromise between the quiet and expansive marina in Manly and the rustic piles opposite the botanical garden is called Dockside Marina. That marina was affected by the floods and there are no shower, no laundry (the water on the jetty should be just fine) and all the berths are not ready to be used as they need to be dredged. We are back to the wake of the ferries and city cats, to the hotter CBD (more than 36 deg while I am typing), and to the brown water.'

b'But it is a much more economical solution, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be visiting the library regularly again and it should be more practical to sort out few things.'
