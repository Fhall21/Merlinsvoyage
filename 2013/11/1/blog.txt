Paragraph:|
One thing Felix learnt in Australia is confidence. He proudly stood on the stage today to convince his friends to vote for him to be the captain of his school house. Is it the beginning of a political career? The election results will be out next week - stay tune.
|Paragraph:|
Here is his speech:
|Paragraph:|
Good afternoon teachers and student !
|Paragraph:|
My name is Felix Hall and I’m here so you can vote for me. Why? Well because I would like to be a house captain for Binkinba.
|Paragraph:|
You might have already seen me leading a small group on Mondays and Fridays. Yes, it was me with a friend who started the Dodge Ball Club. Leading those groups gave me experience on how to lead a group of people. If you vote for me, I will use that knowledge to lead you all to happiness. I will also use once again my past experiences to lead Binkinba into victory, giving the other houses a challenge.
|Paragraph:|
I will help you when you need it. How? By lifting your spirit, by making you believe you can do it, making you think positive thoughts only and by giving you support.
|Paragraph:|
I have also represented our wonderful school, in events inside and outside of school. The school selected me, Felix Hall, to participate in districts and gala days. But that’s not all I’ve also represented New Farm State School at a few school fencing competitions.
|Paragraph:|
Else than my experience with Dodge Ball Club, I’ve also got experience by being a Scout leader. I’ve even tried improving the behaviour of younger kids a couple of times. Thanks to that I learned to answer to all of your confusing questions. I’ll then place them on top of my list of things to do.
|Paragraph:|
So please remember to vote for me, Félix Hall.
|Paragraph:|
Just so you can clearly remember to vote for me, here are a haiku and a small limerick poem which you could use to remember me.
|Paragraph:|
Please do remember
|Paragraph:|
To happily vote for me
|Paragraph:|
Yes me Félix Hall
|Paragraph:|
And here is my limerick:
|Paragraph:|
So vote for me
|Paragraph:|
So you could see
|Paragraph:|
What I can do
|Paragraph:|
With you
|Paragraph:|
 
|Paragraph:|
So you could see
|Paragraph:|
What a good leader
|Paragraph:|
I can be
|Paragraph:|
When I give a small reminder
|Paragraph:|
 
|Paragraph:|
I might blabbing on
|Paragraph:|
But still come on
|Paragraph:|
Vote for me
|Paragraph:|
So we could all shout wee-hee
|Paragraph:|
                                                            Thank you for listening!
|Paragraph:|
Felix wasn't elected as a house captain. He then wrote a new speech to be media captain and was elected this time.
