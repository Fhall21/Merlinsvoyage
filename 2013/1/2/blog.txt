Paragraph:|
We were hoping to go sailing this week-end as Emma and Harvey were coming from Sydney. However, the tail of ex-cyclone Oswald decided to play some tricks. I was receiving weather alerts on my phone  like “Heavy rain, destructive winds for Brisbane. Flash and riverine flooding and gusts to 125km/h”. We didn’t think for too long before cancelling our sail in the Bay.

Paragraph:|
The conditions have been really impressive: lots and lots of rain and even more that we can imagine. The Australian weather doesn’t do things in half measures. However, we tried not to be too scared by the rain and went to the famous cockroach race organised by our local pub to celebrate Australia Day. True, a cockroach race with an election of Miss Cocky and much more!

Paragraph:|
Fun crowd, good atmosphere and we even came back with loads of freebies.

Paragraph:|
That evening, we decided to brave the weather again. Who’s seen some fireworks under pouring rain and with strong gusts of wind? Even really soaked, we had a great show.
|Paragraph:|
The weather was even worst today as the rain didn’t stop for a minute and the winds were gusting up to 30+knts. The news was showing terrible pictures of floods and the results of local tornados in South Queensland. Friends were texting us for news or invite to their place, thanks. We added some mooring lines, are monitoring the tide and we are all fine on board, enjoying our dryer!
