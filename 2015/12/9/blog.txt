Paragraph:|
I have been invited by the Brisbane City Council Libraries to read "Merlin's Voyage" and do some nautical related activities. I visited 4 libraries this week and had fun telling our stories to kids from very different social and cultural background. They all went back home with a little rope to practice their knots (figure of eight and reef knot).
