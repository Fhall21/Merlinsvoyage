Paragraph:|
I have few virtual friends with loads in common. Some of them I met on Facebook mainly via two women sailing groups. One is a worldwide group with nearly 5000 members, the other one is an Australian group with nearly 500 members. These groups can provide lots of sailing or cruising information, technical resolutions, cooking ideas, practical solutions and are a good place to have a chat, vent or even promote your work (as my book!). Yesterday, we had our first big Australian meeting. More than 30 ladies and most of their partners (living on board and cruising) from around Brisbane had the pleasure to put a face on a name and chat “for real”. Amazing to see how you can just “click” because you have the sailing bug in common.
