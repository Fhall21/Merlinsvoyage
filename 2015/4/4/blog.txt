Paragraph:|
b'The weather forecast wasn\xe2\x80\x99t looking good: lots of rain and thunderstorms \xe2\x80\x93 not great when you are at anchor. So we stayed at the dock on Friday. We went to the Gallery of Modern Art \xe2\x80\xa6only to find out that Good Friday was one of the two days in the year when it was closed. We had a little shower or two but no real bad weather. So Saturday morning, even if the forecast wasn\xe2\x80\x99t looking better, we decided to throw the lines.'

Paragraph:|
b'Too soon we were back towards the Brisbane river, sails up this time and a roast lamb in the oven. Still no rain and thunderstorms but pink cheeks, sand between our toes and smiles on our face.\xc2\xa0 We all had such a great week-end ignoring the weather forecast.'
