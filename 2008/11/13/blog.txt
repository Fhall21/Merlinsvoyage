Paragraph:|
We are having a good time so far, dispite the few "mal de mer". We are making good progress with a normal speed of 8 knots. We have 2 reefs and a full genoa at the moment and have a good Southerly wind, long may it last!
|Paragraph:|
A valve on the watermaker failed which filled up one of the bigles. This was quite a scare for us, but we were easily able to clear it and replace the valve.
|Paragraph:|
Our AIS system and autohelm is working very well and is making sailing the boat a real pleasure.
|Paragraph:|
Our current position is 32deg 15,9'S and 14deg 08,75'E.
