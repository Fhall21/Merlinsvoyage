Paragraph:|
We have had a fast day today as the wind has been blowing stronger today, from behind, for the whole day. St Helene is now getting closer and we hope to be there on Thursday as we have 95NM to go.
|Paragraph:|
We had an interesting evening as we lost half our electrics while we were doing a reef. It was our DC to DC converter that first blew a fuse then the unit blew. It has now been removed and by passed. I am being kept busy with these maintenance jobs. For once I am glad that I was involed in the building process as it was quite easy to find the fault and resolve it.

Our current position is 17deg 10,73'S and 4deg 28,66'W and are doing 6 knots.
