Paragraph:|
Greg was asked if he could deliver a boat to Lady Musgrave (officially the Southern limit of the Great Barrier Reef). As he couldn't say no, off he went, tacking to avoid the East Australian current, stocking some vitamin Sea and slowly making his way North. Only 2 days later, he enjoyed his quick stop at Lady Musgrave, swam with some manta rays and turtles in a really clear blue water.
