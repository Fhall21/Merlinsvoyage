Paragraph:|
Our best way to clear our mind and be really ourselves is leaving the docks, shaking Merlin’s sails and feeling the wind in our face. We skipped the Queen’s birthday celebrations and escaped to our favourite dunes across the bay. This time, we invited our friends, Desire, John, Zoe and Jazmin to join us.

Paragraph:|
There was a gale warming so we didn’t expect too many boats at the anchorage. In fact, there was only one when we arrived despite the long week-end.  As forecasted, it was windy and the swell was rolling us more than usual but nothing unbearable.  The dunes were ours, our kites had fun dancing with the wind, the kids climbed restlessly the dunes and we had a great time.
