Paragraph:|
We are about one day from Tobago, 148NM. Tobago requires one to check in the moment you arrive and pay overtime if it is out of office hours, so we have had to sail slower for the last two days to ensure that we arrive in the morning. This is very difficult to do for a racing sailor.
|Paragraph:|
The sea is still quite bumpy so we are looking forward to being in a quiet bay with clear water and good diving.
|Paragraph:|
Our current position is 10deg 17,47' N and 58 deg 23,36'W and our speed is 6,5 knots with three reefs and a very small genoa.
