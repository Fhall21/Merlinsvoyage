Paragraph:|
We are still sailing on a very bumpy sea with good waves. From time to time, one of them goes over the deck or sprays the full cockpit area. We are feeling a bite better (stomach wise). However, Greg has a very sore back.
|Paragraph:|
The winds are around 20knts and the sky is still gray. We haven't tried fishing on that leg and don't feel like doing it. Our days are still quite simple with lots of TV as it is a good commun past time. Still no school and not much time spent outside (from time to time we really have the impression to be in a rollercoaster)
|Paragraph:|
Not the best sailing conditions. Merlin is strong and leads us with no hesitation to our destination. We should reach Tobago Wed morning.
|Paragraph:|
Our position is 8deg 36 N 54deg 43 W
