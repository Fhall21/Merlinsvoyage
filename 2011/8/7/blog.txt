Paragraph:|
b'After 3 years of French home schooling, Victor, Felix and Clea started their Australian school today. Ready in their uniforms, excited and unsure, they discovered their new teacher, classroom and most of all, their new friends. Yawning away, their 1st impression was that the school day was very long. However, the three of them were very happy and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t remember the knot in their stomach that had when we left Merlin earlier this morning. They are now impatient to go back tomorrow, discovering more of this new life. We, as parents, are relieved that everything went so well.'
