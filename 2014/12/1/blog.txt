Paragraph:|
The end of the year has been very busy with two graduations (Felix finishing Primary School and Victor finishing Middle school), graduation dinners, Christmas concerts, end of the year drinks and work functions etc. The weather has being busy too, playing its wild card with impressive thunderstorms one after the other, sometimes disturbing our routine.

Paragraph:|
It is also that time of the year where we take our funny hats again. These hats followed us all the way from Cape Town and they always bring smiles on our face when they come out.  So it is time to share our smiles and love.
