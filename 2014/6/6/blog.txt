Our strange week

Paragraph:|
We had quite an “interesting” week. A guy called last week as he wanted to see Merlin. As usual when we have a visit, we spent a good part of our week-end cleaning franticly from the blinds to under the beds, polishing nicely the hulls and cockpit, packing away extra “stuff”. He came Sunday, looked around, asked few practical questions and few technical ones. He seemed happy with his visit, happy enough to call us back few hours later to ask if he could come again the next day. He came on Monday with an offer, a good offer (but still an offer!). We spoke about more practical issues (hauling out, yards, time needed to leave the boat etc). From then, we had thousands of thoughts going into our minds, we had few tears and many strong emotions were invading us. He offered to come back on board to pay 10% deposit on Wednesday.

However, from Tuesday mid-day we couldn’t reach him anymore. We waited on Wednesday but he didn’t come and of course didn’t phone. We tried to call but were only able to leave messages on his voice mail … until Thursday when his phone was disconnected.

Paragraph:|
So here we are, back to square one. Life goes on, still with Merlin. We don’t understand why someone would do that. Is it a prank, a bad joke, a scam or did something really happen to him? Why someone would do that?
|Paragraph:|
After this week  emotional rollercoaster, we are looking forward to having a much better week-end going to see a rugby game (France against Australia) and then going sailing.
