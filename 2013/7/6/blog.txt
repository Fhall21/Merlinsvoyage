Paragraph:|
Felix was selected to participate to a Fashion design workshop organised by the “Queensland Academy” and held at the Queensland University of Technology. From the title of the workshop (“Nerds vs Fashionista s”), we weren’t too sure what would be involved. However, Felix was curious and wanted to give it a try. In fact, it started with a mini-lecture, done by a scientist, on the sun, UVs and sun damage. Then the kids had the mission to design some sun protective garments for a very specific public. Felix was part of the “Tec Boys” team. Their target client was a “typical 25 year old surfer”. They brainstormed for few hours and came up with very impressive pieces of clothing showed during their fashion show. Here are below few photos of their final catwalk.
