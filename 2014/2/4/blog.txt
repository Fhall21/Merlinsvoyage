Paragraph:|
Gregory was on scouts duty Saturday till 2pm for the sign on day so we left only at 4pm with the tide. We arrived at night and enjoyed a glass under the stars once the anchor was hooked.
|Paragraph:|
Everytime we go out it is a big pleasure to see that the watermaker, windlass, instruments and all our  gear work 100%.

Paragraph:|
Ashore, we were attacked by sand flies and horse flies so we didn't stay too long playing on the dunes. Instead, the kids spent few hours jumping and diving in the clear and warm water, tiring themselves to the extreme.

Paragraph:|
After lunch it was already time to leave. The spinnaker came out and pushed Merlin gently back to the river mouth.
