It started with Clea, bright and early Saturday morning. She was so excited with participating in the bouldering Nationals that she woke up just before 5:30am. She prepared her perfect competitor’s breakfast: an egg and an orange. She had to do 7 climbs, some were easy, and others brought frustration. She had two hours to do as much as she could. She spent about 30min trying to complete one specifically difficult climb. She tried 22 times, to finally reach the bonus point but unfortunately not the top. She finished 10th overall and was very happy with her competition. She also showed exceptionally good team spirit and we are so proud of her achievement, after only 7 months of climbing.

Sunday was Felix’s day. Prior to Sunday, he skipped some holidays late morning and woke up really early to start playing clarinet at 7:30am with another hundred children. Few weeks ago he was selected to participate in SHEP 2016 (State Honours Ensemble Program), a state music camp. More than 900 young musicians from Queensland were meeting for 4 days at the Conservatorium to intensely play some challenging new pieces and learn about music reading and ensemble playing. His Sunday concert was impressive and an amazing grand finale. He was there, on stage with his clarinet, in the middle of all these other young passionate musicians, concentrated but with a beautiful smile and happy to perform in a full concert hall.

Today was Victor’s day. He also participated in the bouldering Nationals. His category was the biggest of all with very impressive spiders – oh sorry climbers, from all over Australia and few from New Zealand. They had only 5 challenges to do in 2 hours. These challenges were quite tricky and complex. Only one climber reached the top on all 5. Victor finished 14 overall and he is happy with his results.
