Paragraph:|
While he was on holidays, Victor worked hard to earn extra pocket money. He was also dreaming of new fancy climbing shoes. Today, he could go and buy them. It is his first big expense (yes they are VERY fancy shoes). As a parent, seeing him so proud of them and himself is quite rewarding.
