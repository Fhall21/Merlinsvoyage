Very impressive super storm over Brisbane

Paragraph:|
We had a warning text letting us know that strong damaging winds would be on their way with some rain and thunder. We have the same warning every time there is a storm here. However, that one was very impressive: egg size hail and 70 knots of wind, more than 1000 lighting strikes in 30 min and lots of rain too.

Paragraph:|
Our car, or at least its body, doesn’t seem as strong as Merlin. The strong winds made the hail fall nearly horizontally and we now have a dotted/dented car….like a few thousand people in Brisbane.
