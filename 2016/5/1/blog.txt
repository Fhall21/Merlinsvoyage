Paragraph:|
Time flies and we've been busy. This week end is just a typical example of our schedule.
|Paragraph:|
Clea and Victor had a climbing competition on Saturday. In 1h, they had to climb the most metres, going up and down as many times as they could and adding the distances climbed. Clea arrived 3rd and Victor 2nd, bringing back home their 1st climbing medals.

Paragraph:|
Greg went camping with Felix, Clea and some scouts the next day, enjoying our second long week-end in a row (photos to come).
|Paragraph:|
Victor and I stayed to study. Since I started my course, I’ve been working every day sometimes quite long hours. I’ve been offered a temporary office that I mainly use on week-ends. It is very close, very practical and overall it's been really great to have this extra space to spread out my books and notes  without packing back everything at the end of the day.

Paragraph:|
We still take time to enjoy the river life. As the sun rises later and later, we thought summer was gone but it came back again with its heat and even few clouds giving us beautiful skies.
