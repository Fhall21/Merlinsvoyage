Paragraph:|
Happy New Year to all of you ... from the doldrums which means NO wind - except when some squals arrive.
|Paragraph:|
We just entered the transition zone between northern and southern Hemispheres and our speed is only 4 knt. However, we had a good squal 1/2h earlier: it helped rinsed Merlin which was really salty, but pushed our speed to 10knt. It was our fisrt big rain since we left Cape Town.
|Paragraph:|
A big tanker crossed our way (or is it us who crossed her way) and we called them with the VHS to ask them the weather forcast: "the weather is fine" dixit the radio! What can be a fine weather for a tanker which does between 16 and 20knt in anycase! Anyway, we wished them Happy New Year and it was nice to speak to someone else.
|Paragraph:|
We had a little reception with presents for Neptune as we passed the Equator last night.
|Paragraph:|
The kids don't understand all these maritime traditions, but they will have their certificat and they will be proud of it latter in their life (..we hope!)
|Paragraph:|
Also bake some more breads: quite something to bake some bread when it is 33 deg outside but the dough does rise very well.
|Paragraph:|
As a New Year dinner, we had pizzas and a great luxury on a sailing yacht: ICE CREAM for desert!
|Paragraph:|
As we are all feeling much better, school should start again in a day or two - slowly as the teacher is also busy with her watches.
|Paragraph:|
Our position is 1deg 36N 44deg 44 W ...and the wind is back pusing us back to 9knt!!!
|Paragraph:|
Fair winds for those leaving for the Cape to Salvador race in 2 days.
|Paragraph:|
All the best wishes for 2009!
