Paragraph:|
We arrived Down Under 2 years ago, not really knowing what we would do in Australia but knowing we had to stop cruising. The small town of Bundaberg was a good spot to start learning about the Australian way of living, to find out about cell phones again, about administrative obligations and about the cost of living (that what a big eye opening as we were still transferring from South Africa). We were daily surprised and we learnt enormously. After few weeks, we arrived in Brisbane, which at that time, seemed a big place, as our recent references were only small island cities. We started looking for work intensively, applied to lots of positions and had many refusals. Then the big 2011 flood stroked the city and neighbouring areas. We escaped the river, its debris, its current and its potential dangers and found shelter at Manly for few weeks. Was it where we wanted to settle?

Paragraph:|
Greg started working at a transport company and his visa came through. However, he changed job quite rapidly and started working as a group accountant with the company he is still working with. Now his Crocs, shorts and tee-shirts only get out of his locker on week-ends. He had to fit to the formal style and started a collection of shirts, all coming from the same shop where he is now well known. He rides to work on a much fancier bike than the one he started going around with. After 2 oceans crossing, even the technicians of the bikes shops didn’t want to see this “old” bike in their workshop …it was for sure the good reason to upgrade.

Paragraph:|
Victor, Felix and Clea started school and in English for the first time. They adapted quickly to the Australian system not without a few hiccups, which are not country specific. Even if they would love to skip their French, we are still doing the Cned (their French corresponding system) Monday to Friday between 7 and 8am. They also found some new activities to complete their day. The boys enrolled at the local scouts group on Tuesday evening. The three of them are playing cricket on Thursday and Sunday morning and doing fencing on Friday evening. Victor plays the guitar on Wednesday and Clea swims on Monday. They have made new friends, have learnt a lot and are growing fast (Victor’s feet are now much bigger than mine). They mention our cruising life often, did presentations at school and are proud of their experiences.

On my side, I try to run smoothly our daily life, driving the kids around, cooking good meals and making sure everybody has the right thing at the right time. I could be busy enough but I don’t want to be a house wife so I am still looking for my perfect job. Nevertheless, for a few months, I have been working at the NAATI centre where people sit for their translator or interpreter tests. It is a customer services job. I have my days where I feel frustrated because I am far away from a scientific role. However, I have a great boss and I meet all kind of people (some are doing this exam for immigration purposes) with interesting stories. My work hours are during school time and my office is only 5 min walk from the marina. I also had a good experience at teaching French and my student made impressive progresses (why Greg is not following??). As I wanted to share some of my emotions and feelings from our cruising experiences, I wrote few articles in different sailing and travel magazines. I am fencing with the kids on Fridays, try to go to yoga and swim when I can and I am waiting for an injury to disappear to be able to run again.
|Paragraph:|
We are still living on Merlin, moored at Dockside Marina We are trying to go out in the bay whenever the tides, the weather and our plans allow it. We are still looking for a new owner who would take over Merlin and continue to add to the miles, shake the sails and discover new horizons as Merlin, after all, is a sailing boat.

Paragraph:|
These last two years went pretty fast. We had ups and downs but we learnt a lot, met new friends, discover a new way of living, got used to the local accent and we are nearly accustomed to the cost of living in Australia. Brisbane isn’t in fact a big city and looking back we are impressed with all our miles stones achieved in the last two years.

Now, it is time to celebrate and have a drink!
