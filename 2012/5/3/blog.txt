Hi,
|Paragraph:|
Two weeks ago I came second in the cross country in my age group. The ones who came between 1st and 5th are going to the Cross country District. So I’ve been selected to go. I have new running shoes to help me go faster. Since two days I’ve been training and running 2kms along the river. Today I bet my record. I did 9min 30 sec. Will keep you posted of my progress!
|Paragraph:|
Felix
