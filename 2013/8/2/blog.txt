Paragraph:|
It didn’t take me too much talking to convince Greg to join the rally which was happening today in the city to save the reef.
|Paragraph:|
The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system composed of over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands stretching for an area of nearly 350 000 km2. However, there are huge threats emerging from too many industrial developments along the reef coastline (coal and gas plants). During our sailing trip we saw too many places where the reef wasn’t as healthy as it should. It was important for us to participate today and raise our voice. It is critical to preserve these magical environments so we can enjoy them as much as we should and our future generations would be able to appreciate it for many years to come.

Paragraph:|
It was inspiring to be with so many people (apparently 4000) walking and singing in the streets for such a good cause. There was such a good spirit amongst the people of all ages.
