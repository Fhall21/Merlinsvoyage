Paragraph:|
Odd date for Father’s day, but Father’s day it was today in Australia. After an early presents ceremony, we all went bushwalking in Moogerak Peaks National Park. Greg had the honour of choosing our destination. It was a steep ~2h walk up through a dry eucalyptus forest full of small wildlife. At the summit we were greeted by a magnificent view of the valley nearly 700m down below. Great walk, great drive, great day and happy father’s day!
