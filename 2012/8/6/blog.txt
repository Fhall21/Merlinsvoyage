Paragraph:|
From Felix's class blog (wrote by Mr Hughes his teacher)
|Paragraph:|
"This week's SotW is awarded to someone who consistently puts in a top effort to homework and classwork, as well as showing initiative and helping others in the classroom when he has finished his work early. This was highlighted this week - while waiting for his laptop to load, he walked around the class asking any of the students whether they needed help with their work. Felix, excellent job this week - a deserve recipient of the SotW!"
