Paragraph:|
If you were thinking of one day coming to visit us (anyone?), September is the time to come to Brisbane. Not only because the days are getting longer and warmer (not that winter is really harsh under these latitudes) and because the jacarandas are blooming everywhere, but because it is the Brisbane Festival. The city is dressed in pink. Story bridge has its pink lights, pink flags are flying high up on the light poles and some huge pink rabbits are dispatched through the city.

Paragraph:|
Over 3 weeks, more than 50 shows are given, all styles being represented (cabaret, opera, theatre, dance, circus, etc.). There are also free concerts and a magnificent laser show (with synchronised music) done from a barge on the river. The new show is not on line but to have an idea I leave you with Mr Google
|Paragraph:|
We saw Opus (http://www.brisbanefestival.com.au/events/view/opus) last week. Shostakovich’s music is played live on stage by the renowned French Debussy String Quartet while acrobats from the Australian circus company Circa tumble, spin and fly around the musicians in a delicate and savage dance.

Next Saturday is the Grande finale with the biggest Australian fireworks to be displayed in various spots across the city, from bridges, to barges and tall buildings.
