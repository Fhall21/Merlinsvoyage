Life goes on, on the Brisbane river

Paragraph:|
A third of June is already gone and I haven’t posted any news. Everything is going well on board and in fact, our life might seem very similar to any landlubber. We had few medical hiccups for Clea and myself, but we both feel fine again. This week-end was a 3-day week-end as Australia also celebrates the Queen jubilee. We had a boat visit on Saturday so used our now good practice to clear and clean Merlin again. We wanted to go back to the bay but the rain and cold weather were pretty uninviting so we stayed at Dockside, enjoying our heater and the warmth from the oven where cakes and pizzas were baking. The kids played computer games, Victor invented a new “Hunger games” Lego game, we watched some movies and we had tea with friends.

Paragraph:|
My bag is packed as I am going to France tomorrow for 3 weeks, leaving behind kids and hubby who keeps telling me that everything will be fine. Our invaluable temporary crew, Mamouss, is getting married, which is more than a good reason to go back home.
|Paragraph:|
The kids or Greg might feel like posting some news again soon, otherwise, dear reader, you’ll have to be patient for some updates.
