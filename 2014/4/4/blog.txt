Paragraph:|
Four days off and perfect weather (even if lacking some wind) means we went out in Moreton Bay for our Easter week-end.

Paragraph:|
We met up with some cruising friends and went snorkelling on Tangalooma's wrecks. Victor said it better than all of us: "it was so great to see some fish and corals again". It was a good exercise to see if our masks and snorkels were still fitting. Some adjustment had to be done. Wow the kids feet are growing fast!
|Paragraph:|
We were invited on another boat for sundowner - a real cruising tradition. We ended up with 4 other couples who all crossed the Pacific in the last few years. Without knowing them all, we had such a good time, enjoying great company, a good drink, an amazing sunset which became a sky full of stars.
|Paragraph:|
Sunday morning, very early, the kids came to wake us up as they couldn't wait any more for their eggs hunt. Smiles and chocolate for breakfast can't be bad.

Paragraph:|
Lots of reading, playing and relaxing, warm sun and clear sky, blue and warm sea, dolphins, turtles, soft sand and shooting stars: ideal combination for a perfect week-end away.
