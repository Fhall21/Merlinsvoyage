Paragraph:|
b'The rain wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to scare us discovering around Brisbane and enjoying the car we can use during the week-ends. And that time, we had \xe2\x80\x9cDarling\xe2\x80\x9d with us! Greg\xe2\x80\x99s new toy was nicknamed already. A GPS should in fact be called a GMS for \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cGlobal Marriage Saver\xe2\x80\x9d as all our drives around always ended up in lots of tensions between the driver and the navigator (it seems -for us- so much easier to navigate at sea!). So, we went to a new \xe2\x80\x9cpark\xe2\x80\x9d for a walk without getting lost and only to discover that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a park but a hilly forest. We went for our muddy walk, even with the inadequate shoes: Felix and myself finished bare feet. We then made another discovery, magical this one. The young crew was complaining before we left Merlin but Mother Nature offered them the best remedy for their moaning. Smiles and energy were back. Clea even went for an unwanted swim in the river but didn\xe2\x80\x99t complain for the rest of the walk.'
