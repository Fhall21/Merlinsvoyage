Victor had a poem to share (from Alfred Noyse)
|Paragraph:|
Greg was busy trying to sort out few things before the start of his holidays, which was on Friday. Friday was also Victor’s last day at primary school. The year 7 students have then the privilege to ring the school bell, the last ring of the year but mostly their last ring of their primary years. It was quite an emotional little ceremony.
|Paragraph:|
This is a very busy time and every reason is good to have a party. For example, we had 3 yesterday: a farewell party, a pool party then a Christmas party. We managed to do all three without trouble!
|Paragraph:|
It is also this time of the year were traditions are going strong. This morning we braved the heat and started baking our “bredele” (traditional Christmas biscuits from Alsace). Clea and Felix were just perfect little chefs.
