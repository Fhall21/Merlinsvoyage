Paragraph:|
Friday night we had fun at the House of mirrors, an amazing and beautiful maze made of mirrors, wood and rusted metal. At first, it took us a good 15 minutes to find our way out. Then our (very competitive) kids started timing themselves and ended up by running through the maze in only 1min.
