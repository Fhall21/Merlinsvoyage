Paragraph:|
I am too Cartesian so I often look at the stats page in Squarespace, our blog provider. So let’s share some numbers first: merlin’s blog is read by about 15 different persons every day (the maximum being about 90 one day), averaging more than 2200 pages view per week. Readers are from all over the planet. Americans, Canadians and French are the most numerous but we’ve had readers from India, Poland, Japan, Slovakia, Chili or Russia. People seem to check the latest post first, which is in fact the main page. If they don’t know us or our blog, they go back to older stories, check who we are, check the boat’s details and our list of links. Most people spent few minutes browsing. New readers tend to spent more time (hours sometimes!). I’ve noticed recently that someone downloaded the full blog including all the photos. That should make quite a nice sailing log once printed!
|Paragraph:|
Most readers do come directly to this address, but also from other links (blogs from sailing friends, “Women and Cruising”, our sale advert, etc). Google (mostly) leads new readers through their key words to the blog. Of course there are all the classic key words: “Merlin”, “catamaran” or “sailing”. The logical ones like “crusing family” or “Pacific crossing”. There are also the odd ones like “Mamouss”, “charades”, Felix a 7 ans” or “Mamitupu”.
|Paragraph:|
The aim of the blog was to send, as often as possible, a little thought and share our discoveries. Our friend Teresa started it for us nearly 3 years ago so we would just “feed” it regularly. It is in fact easier and more convenient to write a short post and add a photo than to send tens of emails telling nearly the same stories. Our blog is not the most popular. But it is alive for our families and friends who are wondering what we are up too.  However, Merlinsvoyage.net went over this main aim and we have had nice emails from total strangers. Most of the time their feedback is really encouraging, telling us we’ve inspired them, asking us some tips or just letting us know they love the blue of the photos.
|Paragraph:|
Teresa, thanks again for setting up merlin’s blog and posting all our news while at sea. Family, friends, curious dreamers, dreaming sailors and fellow cruisers thanks for reading Merlin's stories!
