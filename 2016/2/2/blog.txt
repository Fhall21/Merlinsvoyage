Where did February go?

Paragraph:|
The kids are fully back to school and all started their various activities. Victor has been doing LOTS of climbing and is even becoming temporary staff at his climbing gym. Clea started a month ago and seems to love it a lot too. Is it a result of their mast climbing and all their swinging? Felix started cricket (is it his South African blood calling?) and leaving at 6:30am for practice with his school bag, clarinet bag and cricket bag doesn't stop him. The weather has been really hot and the days very busy. So it was that time again when we all felt it was important to disconnect with the rush and reconnect with what's important. Our favorite dunes have that magic spell.
