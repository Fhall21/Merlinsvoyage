Paragraph:|
We've already noticed that the world was quite small and that we could encounter good friends unexpectedly. Yesterday, Gerfried and his wife Pat, came on board Merlin for a drink. Gerfried was the professional builder who finished off Merlin in Hout Bay. After so many years, it was nice to have him on board again and chat - mostly about boats and cruising adventures!
