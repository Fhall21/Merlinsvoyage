Paragraph:|
For his birthday, Greg was given a Tope Rope Course so he could go climbing with Victor and could set their own climbing ropes.
|Paragraph:|
His course starts next week end but today he received his pre-course examination book and a piece of rope. Knots are a favorite for him. However, he needs to know about 50 of them- some of which are quite different from sailing knots. So he decided he had better get working.
