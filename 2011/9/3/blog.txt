Paragraph:|
b'Spring has sprung and it was time to get away and see a flat horizon again. So early Saturday morning, we enjoyed the sun rising above the city. We headed out the river while Felix went to the top of the mast to clean the main sail track. No wind and few hours of motoring took us to the North of Moreton Island where we spent the afternoon and night. The kids found their marks on the beach in 2 sec, digging, running, not noticing the time flying away...while Greg was doing some TLC to Merlin\xe2\x80\x99s hulls. A beautiful sunset made a perfect backdrop for our 1st evening at sea for a too long time. '

Paragraph:|
b"We reached Flinders Reef early Sunday. Apparently this reef has the highest number of coral species of any sub tropical reef system along Australia's east coast. The water was so clear and blue around us again.. We jumped in (with our wetsuits as the sea temperature was \xe2\x80\x9conly\xe2\x80\x9d 20 deg C!) and enjoyed schools of fish, turtles swimming close by and yes a high diversity of corals."

Paragraph:|
b'We even saw the splash of a whale before we left. We spent the next 2 days at our usual spot off the big dunes of Moreton  Island. Always so beautiful and peaceful. '

Paragraph:|
b'We had fun taking all the toys out again, running and sliding down the dunes and enjoying a drink at sunset. On Tuesday morning, the wind pick up and the sails went up. Felix steered proudly Merlin (with smooth hulls again) back to the river.'
