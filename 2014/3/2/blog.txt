Boat tip #4: Fresh greens on board (especially when cruising)

Paragraph:|
Sprouts are an easy way to have fresh green vegetables for salads and enjoy lots of great nutrients (eg Vitamins C, B and carotene). Sprouting is easy, cheap, fun and rewarding. After soaking overnight the seeds, the germination process takes only a few days depending of the seeds. I mainly use Alfalfa, celery, fennel, fenugreek, beans, lentils, etc.

Paragraph:|
I use a simple glass jar with a piece of cloth or nylon window screen secured over its rim and a proper “sprouts grower” (mainly for bigger seeds). The sprouts are rinsed two to four times a day. It is important to drain any excess of water properly to avoid any bacterial growth (NB on the photo above the seeds are soaking for few hours before being drained). After 4-5 days they are ready to be mixed in a delicious salad.
