Paragraph:|
Over the week-end, there are two main common activities in Australia:
|Paragraph:|
- barbequeing - "Sausage sizzle" is in fact the proper name when sausages are the victims of the BBQ
|Paragraph:|
- going to the park and have fun as parks are well geared (great jungle gyms, tables, shaddy spots and of course BBQs).
|Paragraph:|
This week-end we were real Australians. We volunteered to help the scout group to raise money at the local food festival. The scale of this sausage sizzle was just a little bit bigger than our normal "braai" as 800 sausages were sold in 6 hours!

Paragraph:|
We also went to an amazing park with Clea. Again, different scale: huge slide, long flying fox and lots of green spaces under an amazing blue sky.
