Paragraph:|
We don’t need a good reason to go sailing. However, when the kids don’t have school on a Monday, it is clear that the long week-end will be out in the bay. The weather decided differently. Impressive thunders and heavy rain early Saturday morning made us change our mind. It was a good choice as the storm played new tricks the afternoon.Merlin even saw some hail for the first time on its deck. …we could then also see France winning the semi-final!

Paragraph:|
The weather forecast for Sunday being near perfect, we headed down the river with the tide at sunrise. Beautiful sea, blue sky and warm sun were just great extras for that day. Casting of the lines brings us smiles and hearing the water rushing under the hulls has a magical effect on all of us. It is amusing to see how everybody finds again their sailing/cruising reflexes (as it is reflexes!). We appreciated every moment of our very still evening and colourful sun downer…trying not to think  too much of our car that we left in a paying spot but without paying.
|Paragraph:|
This morning, the wind picked up (up to 25knt), the showers poured down and we sailed back home quite fast but still smiling.
