Paragraph:|
Had a great weekend of racing the VX One. First day was light 3-8 knots, but the second day was 20-25 knots. Our top speed was over 18 knots. It was lots of fun even though we weren't in the front. We just need to work on our boat handling a little, like me finding the toe strap after a tack would help!
