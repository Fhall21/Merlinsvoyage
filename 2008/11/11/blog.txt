Paragraph:|
We did not have such a good day today as we blew our asymmetrical spinnaker. The wind was 15-20 knots, but the sea was a little bumpy. This means that our down wind sailing will be a little slower from here on. I don't think that the asymetrical sails were designed for the dead downwind sailing that we were doing. Our main sail got a minor tear in it on the luff, but we have patched it and can continue using it.
|Paragraph:|
Our progress is still good as we are on 574 NM and doing about 7 knots with a small genoa and 3 reefs in the main. The wind is about 27 knots from behind. Our current position is 29deg 56.73'S and 7deg 35.10'E.
|Paragraph:|
Our meals are getting a little more elabourate each day. We had a great fruit salid for lunch.
|Paragraph:|
The kids are well and settling into sailing life. Victor made a really cool lego boat today and Felix was out helping me put in a reef.
