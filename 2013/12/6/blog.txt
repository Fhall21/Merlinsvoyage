Paragraph:|
On Saturday, after 2 hours of abseiling Victor jumped on a mountain bike. With Felix they had a training session organised by the Brisbane city council at The Gap. Because the kids mustn’t be better than us, Greg and I also went for a ride in the forest. Riding every day to work Greg is still the best of all. However, I should train more because Victor is in harmony with his bike, climbing every steep hill easily and is fearless while going down. There are few great mountain bike spots not too far from the city and The Gap is one of them only 30min from the marina. The eucalyptus forest smells delicious and the shade is always welcoming.

Paragraph:|
During this time, Clea was “hip ho-ping” hard (3h), rehearsing for her end of the year show coming on soon.
|Paragraph:|
I stopped at 4EB radio for one of my 10 minutes talks. It was on the Marquises  Islands.

|Paragraph:|
Our recent week-ends were all rainy. This time, we had a clear and beautiful sky. We then took our bikes for a short sunset ride to the Big Wheel. There are still few things we haven’t done in Brisbane and going on the Big Wheel in South Bank was one of them. I tried to ignore my vertigo and show the kids it was a lot of fun to be up high in the sky recognising the buildings we know. Unfortunately, after 15sec I had to stop taking photos and was holding my seat tightly (just in case!) and was concentrating while checking the horizon.

Paragraph:|
After each round, I was relaxing more and more but was quite happy to walk out. Greg and the kids had a ball.

Paragraph:|
Sunday morning we participated to a beach clean up action which was happening 5 minutes from the marina.

Paragraph:|
The kids were keen to show their civic attitude, which however faded after 30minutes of rubbish picking. Clea thought it was too smelly and not fun, Victor preferred exploring the mangroves, picking up only the big items (plastic bags or plastic bottles). Nevertheless, we collected a good amount of debris, mainly plastic stuff. We even won 2 ticket for Jack Johnson’s concert on Saturday. It is always worth doing some good!
|Paragraph:|
And then it was the scouts end of year BBQ with a badge ceremony.

Paragraph:|
What a full week-end! I would be very happy to have a new week-end just to recuperate from this one! However, the last week of term, which is also the last week of the school year, begins with a respectively full agenda. We’ll deserve our coming up holidays!
