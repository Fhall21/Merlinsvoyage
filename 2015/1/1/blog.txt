Paragraph:|
b'After four weeks away, 7000 km under the wheel and lots of astonishing moments, we are now back on board in a hot and humid Brisbane. It is going to be hard not to use too many superlatives as our road trip was just amazing. So let\xe2\x80\x99s start with the negatives: Tasmania is too far away and Australia is a really big country \xe2\x80\xa6I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of others!'
|Paragraph:|
b'After few days in Sydney\xc2\xa0 meeting up with our old South African friends Emma and Harvey and seeing again our sailing buddies from SV Nika (met first in Panama), a few hops here and there, a too quick visit of Melbourne, we boarded the Spirit of Tasmania, all excited.'

Paragraph:|
b'Our three weeks traveling around were full of excitements, breathtaking views, friendly encounters, delicious tastings, astounding discoveries, laughters and a great family spirit. We arrived on a cold day and our first stop was to wear our thick jackets and buy some gloves. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t remember the last time I slept with some socks on, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see myself not doing it for few cold nights in our tents. We learnt quickly that you can have four seasons in one day in Tasmania.'
