Paragraph:|
After all these days sitting and furiously studying, I had a strong need to slip on my hiking shoes again. Sunday was a perfect winter day to go and explore a new forest. This time, we added an extra requirement to our walk. We had to find some boulders so Victor, Cléa and Greg could climb and have fun on top of our 10km walk. White Rock seemed the perfect place to fulfil our requirements and was indeed a great place to explore.
