Paragraph:|
After watching Invictus again but this time with the kids, we were in a Springboks phase. So when we heard that they were coming to Brisbane to play against the Wallabies, it didn't take very long to book our tickets to go and see the match at the Suncorp stadium.

Paragraph:|
Clea was the most excited of all and she was talking about this up coming game very intensly for a week. The kids were geared properly, we dug out our new South African flag and Clea even made her own paper rainbow flag.

Paragraph:|
We arrived early. It was nice to feel the vibe growing up in the stadium and seeing it filling up with nearly 44 000 spectators. There were quite a few other green and gold shirts and we could hear a very familiar accent around us.
|Paragraph:|
The kids tried to remember few words of the South African Anthem but singing the Australian one is much easier as they practice at school every week. However, the heart spoke clearly and with joy we were all cheering "Go Bokke go!" (hey yes, even me!)

Paragraph:|
The Sprinboks did really well, leaving the Wallabies supporters very embarrased or commentating harshly the ref decisions apparently always in the Bokke's favour.

Paragraph:|
The final score was 38 Springboks - 12 Wallabies. Well done Bokke!
|Paragraph:|
 The rematch will be in Newlands (our previous neigbourghood)  in 2 weeks.
