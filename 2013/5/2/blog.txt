Paragraph:|
This week-end was the family scout week-end away. However, I decided to stay behind and leave Greg and the kids enjoy their camping trip to Noosa. Father bounding is also important. Clea was so excited to be part of a scout adventure that she packed her own bag, without missing anything.

Paragraph:|
I enjoyed a quiet time on Merlin, cooking what I like eating (but what the kids don’t like much), watching French movies, listening to my music without being interrupted. Our neighbours offered me their car for the week-end but it was just so nice to have Merlin just for myself and I just walked to my friend for a great “girls only” evening.
