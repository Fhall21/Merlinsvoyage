Paragraph:|
Sailing or not sailing? That was our question on Saturday morning. Some friends were supposed to join us for a sail in the bay but had to cancel because of a sick child.
|Paragraph:|
We then decided to breath, relax, and enjoy our free time doing not much, playing games and watching a family movie... It is amazing how time flies when you don't do much! However, Merlin got some TLC and we hit the waves this morning as the sea was still calling us.
