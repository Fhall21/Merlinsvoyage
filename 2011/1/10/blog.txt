b'Emergency call: more rain expected over Queensland, more water in the river, opening of the dam, really high tide. So, at lunch time, as many other boats, we decided to leave our city spot, and headed down stream to a marina, which is outside the river.'

Paragraph:|
b'We are now safely tucked along a jetty in Manly, with no fears of debris or other boats bashing into Merlin. On our way down we were joined by all the local City Cats ferries, which are now moored near by. So, it was the right call.'
