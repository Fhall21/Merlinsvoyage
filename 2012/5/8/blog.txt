Paragraph:|
Felix’s school was invited to sing (in Chinese!!) and dance at the opening of the Buddha Birth Day Festival. The official web site says “The Brisbane's Buddha Birth Day Festival is one of Queensland’s most prestigious cultural events, now recognized as the largest annual Buddhist Birth Day Festival in the world”. We tasted the spring rolls, tried the wishing bell and experienced a bit of Chinese culture just 5 min from home. Felix was very concentrated and I can’t say who was the proudest, him or the parents.
