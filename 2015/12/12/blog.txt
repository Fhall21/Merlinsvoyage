Paragraph:|
This year, Greg took the “Movember” challenge very seriously. He didn’t only grow a moustache but also a full beard. For those who don’t know “Movember” comes from “mo” a diminutive for moustache and November and was created to raise awareness for men's mental illness and try to change the face of men's health.
|Paragraph:|
Greg liked the few minutes saved in the morning. After a month of hardwork and few fun looks, he shaved again - apparently for me!
