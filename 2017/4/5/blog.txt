Paragraph:|
Since we left South Africa, we’ve had visits from old friends from Strasbourg and Cape Town, proving that the world is not as big as we think but also showing us that friendship can last few decades. David Hibberd is an old sailing friend of the Halls and is now cruising the world with his family. It was nice to have them all on board last Saturday, share some Pacific cruising stories and revive many exotic names. The kids connected really quickly, as cruising kids do.
