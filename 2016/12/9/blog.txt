Paragraph:|
We’ve already had some unbelievably hot days, meaning temperatures higher than 30°C (from 9:00am) and a really high humidity. These weather conditions are synonym to summer storms. Last week, I received 6 warnings from the Brisbane Weather Bureau announcing “Thunderstorm with damaging (or sometimes described as destructive) winds and large hailstones”.
|Paragraph:|
If we are around (usually we are as it happens at the end of the day), we try to switch off the shore power, secure everything and pack away our outdoor cushions. These storms are always quite spectacular, short but intense. Sometimes we can even hear the thunder via the water.
|Paragraph:|
Two good points of these storms:
|Paragraph:|
1- they bring water: Queensland needs some and it is an effortless decl rinse
|Paragraph:|
2- they offer us spectacular skies.
