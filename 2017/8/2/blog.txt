Paragraph:|
During Science Week I had the opportunity to take Clea to fly a drone. There was an obstacle course that we had to fly around. She was really impressive ad succeeded at her 1st attempts. I needed more trials but we had fun … She has now her drone pilot certificate, and we just need a drone!
