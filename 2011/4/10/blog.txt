Paragraph:|
b'We went South of Brisbane again as we had such a good experience last week-end. Springbrook National Park with its subtropical rainforest was our destination for a short walk. Impressive fig trees, spectacular water falls with water tumbling behind Natural Bridge (an arch of basalt), the sun playing hide and seek behind the canopy and the calls of riflebirds made this green escape another positive experience.'
