Paragraph:|
Today was "student free day" which means no school for our kids. No school, no activities, no work for me and good weather? It didn't take long to convince Greg to take his day off and throw the lines as soon as Felix finished his new audition for the Conservatorium on Sunday. 
|Paragraph:|
At the last minute (in fact hour), we invited two little friends to join us. It is always nice to share some sailing time and show to the kids what living on board can really be. Usually coming for a sleep over is quite exciting so imagine going for some adventure in the bay!
