Paragraph:|
We did it!! We crossed the Atlantic Ocean.
|Paragraph:|
We arrived in Brazil (Fortaleza) yesterday. At 10am, Merlin was anchored and the lines were out, calm after a great crossing, especially the last 2 days and nights which were bumpy and windy.
|Paragraph:|
Merlin is a great boat. “She” is great, strong and leads us with pride. Seeing her go in the dark, on a bed of waves and under the stars, is a strong feeling. She is taking us, safely.
|Paragraph:|
Our crossing from Ascension to Fortaleza was faster than planned because we had great (strong) winds at the end. We did nearly 190nm in 24h.
|Paragraph:|
For a few days has been hot and humid. At sea we had more showers than before, at sunrise or under the stars.
|Paragraph:|
We caught another fish. We are thinking that it is a barracuda. It was tasty and still amazing to catch our own fish and to have it on our plate few hours latter. We still have few pieces in the freezer.
|Paragraph:|
We did “St Nicolas”, baking with 30 deg some special cakes (a speciality from Alsace). We had our shoes out on the deck and of course they were filled with chocolate the next morning.
|Paragraph:|
We saw beautiful sunsets and wouldn’t be able to say which one was the best. We had skies full of stars. For few days we also had a full moon, illuminating the waves at night.
|Paragraph:|
Maybe the kids thought it was long crossing. So we did few things with them: a message in a bottle that we threw in the sea and hope to have a reply, we had a pancake evening (quite something in the middle of the Atlantic to flip your pancakes), we did some Christmas decorations which make Merlin even more beautiful, we played more card games, ...and we braaied some marshmallows on the stove!
|Paragraph:|
We have expressed some of our feelings from this crossing, but we are proud and happy.
|Paragraph:|
Yesterday we had a nap, cleaned the salt off Merlin and went for a swim in the swimming pool attached to the marina; so we are back to civilization for few days. Most of all we slept SOOOO well with no watches, no noise, no wave and no sail to check!
|Paragraph:|
We are going to the beach this morning, then we’ll do some shopping as Xmas is in a few days and we need few little things!
|Paragraph:|
We will be all together for Christmas, still in Fortaleza.
|Paragraph:|
Mamouss is flying back to France on Friday. We might anchor somewhere in Brazil to enjoy the country a little more and then we will continue sailing to Trinidad.
|Paragraph:|
Feel free to let us know if you are keen to join us!
|Paragraph:|
Lots of love and MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!
