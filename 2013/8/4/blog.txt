Paragraph:|
Today, we had a beautiful weather and not too hot yet; so it was perfect for a walk. We headed to D'Aguilar National Park again for a great walk in the rainforest. We are always amazed by the diversity of the rainforest with its magnificient fig trees, fun liana vines to play with, cheerful bird songs.
