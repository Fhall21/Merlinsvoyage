Paragraph:|
Two weeks ago we started having a lot of rain, enough for some mushrooms to grow full size overnight.

Paragraph:|
Greg thought it was the perfect weather to do a little maintenance like replacing our 8 year old batteries. They were still working fine but this is the kind of work you prefer to do before you really need it. To be able to fit these 8 new Mastervolt batteries, that, of course, have a different shape and size than our previous ones, Greg had to measure very carefully the battery locker and think of the best fit. After few long hours of fiddling and trying few options, in a very "yogastic position", he solved his puzzle and is now very proud of his new set up. Everything fits just perfectly. Really worth the effort!
