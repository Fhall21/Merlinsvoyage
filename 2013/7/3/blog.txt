Paragraph:|
Hello the world! I decided to be involved in a fundraising campaign against hunger. The 16th of August, for 40h, I will stop 2 things which are important for me. I’ll stop reading because from morning to evening I always have a book in my hands. I’ll also stop eating sugary things, meaning no dessert and snack because I love sweet food. Books and sweet food are luxury and I want to try to live without them for 40h to help children in need around the world.
