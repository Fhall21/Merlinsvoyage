Paragraph:|
Nothing better than a little swim in the morning! That was so true when we were surrounded by clear blue and warm water. We are missing these quick dips before breakfast so Greg decided it was time again. Even the occurrence of the bull sharks and the very poor visibility of the brown Brisbane river couldn’t stop him. The aim was however quite different: he wanted to catch these keys lost few days ago and that we couldn’t fish with a magnet. After few minutes of searching in the near darkness of the bottom in the muddy slime he came back to the surface forced to acknowledge that we now had to spend a couple of 100 $ in a new car key. Gggrr!

Paragraph:|
The tooth fairy was quite busy this week and had to come 4 times on board! She must be pretty poor by now and we are hopping the kids will give her a rest.
