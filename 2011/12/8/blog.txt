Paragraph:|
These last few weeks were busy at school and parties were numerous: Disco Party, Garden Party, swimming carnival, school concert on Tuesday (see photos below), end of the year class party yesterday (with loads of food). The last kids party is planned for this afternoon at the park. The end of the school year arrived very quickly and there is now definitely a Christmassy feel all around, with some excitement, music and decorations. Merlin is getting ready too with new colorful Christmas art and greeting cards. Even the kids are exchanging cards. Clea, being very popular, is the one who received the most of them.
