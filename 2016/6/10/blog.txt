Paragraph:|
After a little break (I will write about that later), we're back on line and with some sporty news. 
|Paragraph:|
Victor and Clea qualified for the climbing Nationals, a 1st for a Hall. There might be some climbing blood on my side as my grand'father was an avid climber as well as my dad. But hey, the Nationals and in Australia! We are very proud supporters of these two rock spiders.
|Paragraph:|
For the last few weeks, Victor and Clea have been training even harder and they will represent Queensland next week in Sydney - so stay tune.
